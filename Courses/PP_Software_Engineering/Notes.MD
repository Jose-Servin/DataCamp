# Software Engineering Concepts

### 1. Modularity
* Improves readability 
* Improves maintainability 
* Solve problems only once 

<p> To write modular code in python we can leverage packages, classes and methods. </p>

### 2. Documentation
* Shows users how to use your project
* Prevents confusion from your collaborators 
* Prevents frustration from future you 

### 3. Testing
* Save time over manual testing 
* Find and Fix more bugs 
* Run tests anytime/anywhere 

### 4. Version Control & Git 

## Introduction to Packages and Documentation 
Basic package installation comes from `pip`; where package and package dependencies are installed.
We can read documentation with the use of the `help()` function. 

## Conventions and PEP 8 

<mark> PEP 8</mark> is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. PEP 8 
lets us know how to format our code to be as readable as possible. In basic format, PEP 8 calls for the correct use 
of whitespace and comments in order to provide a visual aid for the codes process. 

### PEP 8 Tools
Most IDE's provide warning labels, so you can reformat your code to follow PEP 8 conventions. Another option is the 
`pycodestyle` package which is a tool to check your python code against some style conventions in PEP 8.
